### Attention
###### Using bot or any kind of automation is not recommended by the Aliens World. I'm not responsible for any kind of your loss(es). USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

### PS
- ###### "Bot resource(s) throttling" feature disables the check for CPU, NET, RAM usage. This enables the bot to click even when the resources are above 100%.
- ###### On the first run you need to login to your wax account, on the succeeding runs you will be logged in automatically as the session cookies will be saved.
- ###### Follow the prompts in the command terminal.
- ###### You must open the terminal in the same directory where the files are stored.
- ###### Feel free to make suggestions, report bugs on this project's [discussions](https://github.com/theDebonair/awbot/discussions) tab.
